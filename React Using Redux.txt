1. Install Dependencies
	-axios(for making http requests from client side/ to make api calls from client side)
	-react-router-dom(to create single page applications that our page wont be refreshed)
	-redux-devtools-extension()
	-redux-thunk(to make async calls in redux actions)
	-material ui

2. lets check if react application is working

3. Start react app and remove unnecessary files and folders

4. Configure Redux Store
	-create a new folder(store)...> new file store.js in src
	-in beginning we will just configure necessary tools
		-import composeWithDevTools from redux-devtools-extension
		-import combineReducers, createStore, applyMiddleware from redux
		-import thunk from redux-thunk

5. create a root reducer in store.js
	-const rootReducer = combineReducers({});


6. create store 
	-const store = createStore(
  	 rootReducer,
  	 composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk))
	 );

7. export store

8. create actions and reducers folders in store

9. create a new file "authReducer.js" in reducer folder(for holding login and register state and authentication token)


10. in authReducer.js
	-create the intialstate(userDetails : null at the beginning when we start our application)
		-const initState = {
 		   userDetails: null,
		 };

	-create first reducer
		-const reducer = (state = initState, action) => {
   		 switch (action.type) {
    		     case "DUMMY":
            
       		      return {
       		          // returns the previous state
       		          ...state
       		      };
    
       		  default:
      		      return state;
		     }
		 }

11. Now for every reducer ..create an action file.
	-authActions.js in actions folder
		-create a variable(autActions)...will define it later..

12. Import reducer from authReducer in store.js	
	-now access the properties of authreducer in rootReducer.
		-const rootReducer = combineReducers({
		    auth: authReducer,
		 });

13. Now check the app if it is working or not.
